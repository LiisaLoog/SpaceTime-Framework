# SpaceTime-Framework
Code used for analyses in Loog et. al. (2017) Estimating mobility using sparse data: Application to  human genetic variation. PNAS, in press.

The folder contains:

1. R code for sliding window analysis of  (Space-Time-SlidingWindow-Analysis.R) and supporting input data files.

2. Python code for simulations of the 2D mobility model with constant migration rate within each simulation (2D-sim-model.py).

3. C++ code for simulations of the 2D mobility model with episodic change in migration rate (SimChangeMigrate.cpp) and Matlab code for plotting the result (gen_figure.m).
